# TDD
can you create a test driven development document with practical steps  of the development. For example, it should start first with setup go project, setup test suites, and make sure the test can run and test fails, then update the test to make it pass. 
dived the implementation of denv into testable steps. think hard on the dpendencies and make sure the dependent are working and test pass first. one time test, or just write code to make sure it works and then remove it is also acceptable. no need to be too detail on the implementation, clear steps are important.


# Start
I've created a comprehensive Test-Driven Development guide for implementing denv. The guide is structured in 10 progressive phases:
Key Structure:

Phase 0: Setup - Get the Go project running with test framework
Phase 1-2: Foundation - Core utilities and project detection (no dependencies)
Phase 3-4: State & Ports - Environment state and port management (depends on 1-2)
Phase 5: Override System - Variable pattern matching (depends on 3-4)
Phase 6-7: Sessions - Session management and shell integration (depends on 5)
Phase 8: Commands - CLI implementation (depends on all previous)
Phase 9-10: Integration - Full workflows and edge cases

TDD Approach:
Each step follows the pattern:

Write failing test first - Shows what we want to achieve
Run test to see it fail - Confirms test is actually testing something
Implement minimal code - Just enough to make test pass
Refactor if needed - Clean up while tests protect us

Practical Considerations:

Manual tests for things hard to automate (like OS signal cleanup)
Integration tests for full workflows
Mock strategies for user input and shell spawning
Concurrent testing for race conditions
Test helpers for common operations

Dependencies Flow:
The phases are ordered so each builds on the previous:

Paths → Config → Project Detection → State → Ports → Override → Sessions → Commands

This ensures we always have working foundations before building higher-level features.
The guide includes actual test code examples that can be copied and used, making it practical to follow step-by-step during development.
